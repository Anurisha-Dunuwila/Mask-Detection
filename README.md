# Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and SVM

This Python implementation utilizes OpenCV and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to detect whether individuals are wearing masks or not in real-time video streams. Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, this project aims to contribute to public health efforts by providing a tool for automated mask detection. The system employs Haar cascades for face and eye detection, alongside an SVM classifier trained on face images with and without masks. The application detects faces in the input video stream, extracts facial regions, and predicts mask presence based on trained SVM models. The result is displayed in real-time, indicating whether a detected face is wearing a mask or not. This repository includes the necessary code and trained models.
